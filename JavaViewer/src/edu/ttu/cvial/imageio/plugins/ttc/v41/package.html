Provides classes for encoding/decoding images in TTC 4.1 format.
<p>
Key new features in TTC 4.1 over 4.0 include:
<ul>
<li>Region-Of-Interest (ROI) decoding <br>
This is an experimental feature. Currently, decoding a ROI requires roughly
half of the time compared with decoding a full image. In future version, this
feature will be improved.</li>
<li>Reversible mode <br>
Lossless coding can be achieved by using reversible mode together with quality-index set to 0. When encoding is done in reversible mode, decoding is automatically done in reversible mode. Another benifit of reversible mode is that coding speed is 10-30% faster and memory usage is 40% lower compared with irreversible mode. <br>
However, reversible mode has its drawbacks. For the same bitrate/compression-ratio, reversible mode usually results in lower PSNR (about 1dB) than in irreversible mode. Therefore, users should choose between reversible and irreversible mode carefully.
</ul>
